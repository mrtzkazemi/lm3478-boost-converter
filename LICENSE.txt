CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among
hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the
freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware
designs and products. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence
comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); CERN-OHL-W
(weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it,
in unmodified form only.

You may redistribute and modify this licence itself under the
terms of the CERN-OHL-S v2.0 or any later version.

The precise terms and conditions of the licence are defined in the
following sections.

1.2 'Compatible Licence' means a licence listed in the CERN-OHL-S
Compatibility List, as published by CERN.

code, which can be used to make or modify a Product or to
prepare a Product for production.

1.4 'Product' means any device or physical object, whether
in whole or in part, made using the Source, or the
modifications of such a device or object.

Source or provide a written offer, valid for at least
three years, to provide the Complete Source, at no cost,
to any person in possession of the Product.

4.3 The Licensee must ensure that the Product is accompanied
